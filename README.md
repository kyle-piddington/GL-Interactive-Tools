# GL-Interactive-Tools

This is probably going to fail, but here's the idea.

  - Gizmos are great, and should be easy to build, create, and customize independant of platform, engine, or game.
    - They  aren't.
    
    GL-Interactive-Tools is an attempt at making this process easier while making minimal assumptions about your current project and toolkit, allowing you to pick, choose, and create gizmos on whatever you want, as well as customize the behavior of the gizmo.
